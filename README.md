### Project Overview
---
Welcome to my Data Analysis class portfolio! This repository is a collection of my work, demonstrating the growth of my skills from basic data literacy to the creation of data visualizations. Each project includes analyses, visualizations, and documentation of the techniques used. My knowledge span from foundational data literacy, which laid the groundwork for my understanding of data analysis and manipulation. Explore the projects to see how I applied various Excel functions and features to uncover insights and create compelling visual representations of data.

### Data Sources
The data used in these projects were sourced from a variety of locations including:
Sample datasets provided by course instructors
Publicly available datasets from online repositories
Synthetic data generated for learning purposes

### Tools used
The tools used include 
1. Microsoft Excel: [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   - used for Data cleaning, analysis, and basic visualization.
3. SQL Server: [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server)
   - Database management and querying.
5. Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

### Foundation of Data
This phase serve as an insight to enhance our excel journey, we were introduced to the following:
 1. Data Literacy:
   - Data Generation
   - Data storage
   - Data Stucture
   - Statistic 
   - Data Driven Decision Making
 2. Data Analysis Life Cycle
   - Ingestion
   - Transformation
   - Modeling
   - Visualization
   - Analysis
   - Presentation
  
### Introduction into Microsoft Excel
This phase encompass the following action:
1. Navigating Excel interphase
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Handling missing variables
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Basic Excel Function
#### Data Analysis
The aim of this phase was to perform data manipulation tasks in other to answer questions on different aggregate using different code. Functions used include;
1. overall aggregate;
 - Sum, Average, Max, Min, Count, CountA, Large, Small
```
=SUM(D8:D27)
```
2. conditional funtions;
   - Sumif(s), Averageif(s), Maxifs, Maxa , Minifs, Countif(s), If(s) 
```
=COUNTIF(C8:C27,C19)
```
3. Data extraction and joining;
   - Left, Mid, Right, Concatenate
```
=LEFT(B6,FIND(" ",B6))
```
```
=CONCATENATE(B16&" "&C16)
```
4. Text Cleaning
   - Trim, Lower,  Upper, Proper
```
=UPPER(B7)
```
4. Data retrieval;
   - Vlookup, Match, Xlookup, Index
```
=VLOOKUP(Database!$E21,'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16,2,FALSE)
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis
When delving into the analysis phase of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), we adopt a structured method to comprehend and extract insights from the data to address questions like:
1. Overall sales trend
2. Top selling product by specific region or market
3. Monthly sales pattern
4. Percentage of revenue generated from specific product by region

### Report and Dashboard
This aspect summarizes our data, enabling us to to communicate the results of data analysis in a structured format using the pivot table, and display key performance indicators and metrics in a dynamic, interactive format using charts, graphs.

### Summary
This repository showcases various aspect completed during my Excel class, highlighting my proficiency in Excel skills and techniques. I began with learning foundational data literacy (Foundation of Data), which laid the groundwork for my understanding of data analysis and manipulation. The main source of data used in these projects was provided by the facilitator during the course of learning. This journey culminates in developing advanced dashboards for data visualization.
