This phase serve as an insight to enhance our excel journey, we were introduced to the following:
 1. Data Literacy:
   - Data Generation
   - Data storage
   - Data Stucture
   - Statistic 
   - Data Driven Decision Making
 2. Data Analysis Life Cycle

   - Presentation
  
### Introduction into Microsoft Excel
This phase encompass the following action:
1. Navigating Excel interphase
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Handling missing variables
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Basic Excel Function
#### Data Analysis
The aim of this phase was to perform data manipulation tasks in other to answer questions on different aggregate using different code. Functions used include;
1. overall aggregate;
 - Sum, Average, Max, Min, Count, CountA, Large, Small
```
=SUM(D8:D27)
```
2. conditional funtions;
   - Sumif(s), Averageif(s), Maxifs, Maxa , Minifs, Countif(s), If(s) 
```
=COUNTIF(C8:C27,C19)
```
3. Data extraction and joining;
   - Left, Mid, Right, Concatenate
```
=LEFT(B6,FIND(" ",B6))
```
```
=CONCATENATE(B16&" "&C16)
```
4. Text Cleaning
   - Trim, Lower,  Upper, Proper
```
=UPPER(B7)
```
4. Data retrieval;
   - Vlookup, Match, Xlookup, Index
```
=VLOOKUP(Database!$E21,'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16,2,FALSE)
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
When delving into the analysis phase of EDA, we adopt a structured method to comprehend and extract insights from the data to address questions like:
1. Overall sales trend
2. Top selling product by specific region or market
3. Monthly sales pattern
4. Percentage of revenue generated from specific product by region

### Report and Dashboard
This aspect summarizes our data, enabling us to to communicate the results of data analysis in a structured format using the pivot table, and display key performance indicators and metrics in a dynamic, interactive format using charts, graphs.
